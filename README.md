# CPD--SAS--Programming_3_Advanced_Techniques_and_Efficiencies
Notes and labs from SAS Programming 3 - Advanced Techniques and Efficiencies -- ECPRG393

This course is for SAS programmers who prepare data for analysis. The comparisons of manipulation techniques and resource cost benefits are designed to help programmers choose the most appropriate technique for their data situation.
This course can help prepare you for the following certification exam(s): SAS Advanced Programming for SAS 9.

Learn how to compare various SAS programming techniques that enable you to
- benchmark computer resource usage
- control memory, I/O, and CPU resources
- create and use indexes
- combine data horizontally
- use hash and hiter DATA step component objects and arrays as lookup tables
- compress SAS data sets
- sample your SAS data sets
- create and use SAS data views
- safely reduce the length of numeric variables
- create user-defined functions and informats.
